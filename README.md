# Interview Code Navigator

## 🚀 Master Coding Interview Patterns

Interview Code Navigator is a comprehensive, interactive platform designed to help software engineers master the essential patterns required for technical interviews at top tech companies.

Unlike traditional study methods that rely on rote memorization, this application focuses on **pattern recognition** and **visual intuition**. By breaking down complex algorithms into interactive visualizations and plain-English explanations, we bridge the gap between theory and application.

### ✨ Key Features

-   **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic, state-based animations for 9 core patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS/BFS, etc.) that make abstract concepts concrete.
-   **Curated Video Lessons**: High-quality video explanations sourced from top educators (NeetCode, Reducible, QuanticDev) for each pattern.
-   **Pattern Recognition Trainer**: A dedicated mode to practice identifying the correct algorithmic approach based on problem signals and constraints.
-   **Progressive Learning Path**: Structured curriculum moving from "What is this?" to "When to use it" to "Code Implementation".
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI for a premium, responsive user experience.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide React
-   **Animation**: Tailwindcss-animate, Custom CSS transitions
-   **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM

### 📚 Patterns Covered

1.  **Two Pointers**: Efficient array traversal for sorted sequences.
2.  **Sliding Window**: Dynamic subarray optimization.
3.  **Hash Map**: Frequency tracking and O(1) lookups.
4.  **Sorting & Greedy**: Optimal local choices for global solutions.
5.  **Binary Search**: Logarithmic search in sorted datasets.
6.  **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Deep exploration of trees and graphs.
7.  **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Level-order traversal and shortest paths.
8.  **Backtracking**: Exhaustive search with pruning.
9.  **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization via memoization and subproblems.
